## What GeneLens Does

| Feature | Method |
|---------|--------|
| Differential Expression | Welch's t-test + Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction |
| Volcano Plot | Interactive — labelled gene names, threshold lines |
| Heatmap | Z-scored expression across all samples |
| PCA | Sample clustering to verify group separation |
| GO Enrichment | GO_Biological_Process_2021 via Enrichr API |
| KEGG Pathways | KEGG_2021_Human via Enrichr API |
| ML Classification | Random Forest (200 trees, 5-fold CV, AUC + feature importance) |
| AI Interpretation | Anthropic Claude API — automated biological interpretation |

> GO and KEGG enrichment works for datasets with real gene names (e.g. SOD2, TP53) —
> or IDs GeneLens can map to gene symbols automatically (see below).

## Gene ID Mapping (New in v1.0)

Uploaded or GEO-fetched datasets aren't always keyed by HGNC gene symbol — RNA-seq
pipelines commonly output Ensembl gene IDs (`ENSG...`), and some platforms use Entrez,
RefSeq, or UniProt IDs instead. GeneLens now detects the ID format automatically and
maps it to HGNC symbols using two local, static reference tables (no network calls at
analysis time):

- **`hgnc_mapping.tsv`** — NCBI `gene_info`, covering **193,877 genes** with Ensembl,
  Entrez, RefSeq, and UniProt cross-references
- **`ensembl_to_symbol.tsv`** — a BioMart supplement (**49,132 entries**) filling in
  lncRNA and other non-coding genes NCBI's table misses

This is what lets a raw Ensembl-ID RNA-seq matrix (see the COVID-19 dataset below,
60,683 raw IDs) get GO/KEGG enrichment at all — the mapping step happens automatically
before differential expression, and the app reports how many genes mapped vs. were
dropped.

## Validated on Real Published Data

### Dataset 1 — COVID-19 PBMC RNA-seq (GSE152418, *Science* 2020)

**Scale:** 44,242 genes × 34 samples | 17 COVID-19 patients vs. 17 healthy controls

> GEO's raw matrix ships 60,683 Ensembl gene IDs. GeneLens maps Ensembl → HGNC symbols
> automatically (see [Gene ID Mapping](#gene-id-mapping-new-in-v10) above); after
> dropping unmapped and duplicate IDs, 44,242 genes remain for analysis.

*3,200 upregulated · 2,216 downregulated*

*Clean separation of COVID-19 patients from healthy controls on PC1*

**Key findings:**
- `CDC20`, `FOXM1`, `RRM2` downregulated → immune cell cycle arrest
- `CYP1B1` upregulated → oxidative stress response
- `TGFBR2`, `SETDB1` upregulated → immune evasion and epigenetic reprogramming

### Dataset 2 — Type 2 Diabetes Liver — Workflow Demonstration

**Purpose:** Demonstration of the full GeneLens analysis workflow and biological interpretation capabilities, connecting RNA-seq analysis to oxidative stress pathways studied in my undergraduate thesis.

**Structure:** 226 curated metabolic and oxidative stress genes × 13 samples | 5 Normal vs. 8 T2DM conditions

**Note:** This dataset was constructed as a biologically informed demonstration using gene expression directions and magnitudes derived from published T2DM transcriptomics literature (including Pihlajamäki et al. 2009, GSE15653). It is not a direct download from GEO — it is a curated demonstration dataset designed to illustrate the GeneLens pipeline on biologically relevant gene sets.

*GPX1, GCLM, GSR downregulated — antioxidant enzymes from thesis research*

<img width="1919" height="943" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f415041-4918-4d2a-932d-954a9172ff04" />

*Glutathione metabolic process — enriched among downregulated genes*

**Key findings from demonstration:**
- `GPX1`, `GCLM`, `GSR` downregulated — antioxidant suppression
- `SOD2`, `CAT` strong downward trends — consistent with thesis biochemical findings
- `CYP2E1` upregulated → ROS generation
- **Top GO term:** Glucose homeostasis (GO:0042593)
- **Top KEGG pathway:** Insulin signalling (p=1.86e-08)
